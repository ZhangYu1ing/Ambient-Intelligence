Pea Shooter
===========

### No pet yet? Keep a pea shooter!

Do you want a plant which lives like an animal? It can tell you it’s thirsty, ask you for sunshine, guard your house... Most importantly, you don’t have to walk it at midnight!
This is a plant that can interact deeply with humans. Yes, like the pea shooter in Zombies. You can watch its living conditions, water it and adjust light for it through Web App. It has a bad temper. When feeling uncomfortable, it’ll complain to you through Web App, “Hey! I’m thirsty!” “Slacker! Give me more sunshine!” So be a responsible master and don’t irritate it.
Remember the pea shooter's killer mace? Destroy the zombies!
Our pea shooter is not a pet which does nothing but drinks water. Do pigeons who fly into your house still bother you? Put your pea shooter on your sill. When a pigeon flies into your house, it can recognize it, automatically scare it off by spraying water and show off on it by posting some photos of the pigeon on Web App.
Who doesn’t want such a proud and loyal pet?
