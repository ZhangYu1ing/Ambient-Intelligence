   ![logo](https://github.com/AmI-2018/Pea-Shooter/blob/master/img/logo.gif)  

Do you want a plant which lives like an animal? It can tell you it’s thirsty, ask you for sunshine, guard your house... Most importantly, you don’t have to walk it at midnight!
This is a plant that can interact deeply with humans. Yes, like the Pea Shooter in Plant vs Zombies. You can watch its living conditions, water it and adjust light for it through Web App. It has a bad temper. When feeling uncomfortable, it’ll complain to you through Web App, “Hey! I’m thirsty!” “Slacker! Give me more sunshine!” So be a responsible master and don’t irritate it.
Remember the pea shooter's killer mace? Destroy the zombies!
Our Pea Shooter is not a pet which does nothing but drinks water. It’s able to play music when your children close to it.But if your pet dog comes running toward to Pea Shooter to hurt it, it will spray water to protect itself.All of these activities are based on the image recognition technology and they’ll be sent to your Web App.Of course you can stop spraying or change the music through the Web App too.
Who doesn’t want to have such a proud and loyal pet inside of your apartment?
